# ETH-NFT-Minting-Bot-

This is a simple bot i wrote to mint an NFT and it can be forked and modified to fit your occasion.

Simply clone this repo, fill in the .envExample requirements, after that change the file's name to '.env'

Install dependencies using npm i

Afterwhich go through the tryMint.js file , i made sure to give a detailed explanation of the mint bot.
I wrote out where you might need to change in preparation for an hyped mint.

This is still in the works , i hope to build out a complete app with more functionalities and i sincerely hope this helps you outwith your mint or quest for knowledge .

I'd be happy to collaborate in building out more features or If you have any questions.
